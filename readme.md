AWS is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services like compute power, storage, and databases on a pay-as-you-go basis. Unlike traditional data centers, AWS provides scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions without the need for physical hardware.


2. Explain the core components of AWS.

The core components include EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), S3 (Simple Storage Service), RDS (Relational Database Service), Lambda (serverless computing), VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), and IAM (Identity and Access Management).

3. What is EC2 and how is it used in DevOps?

EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. In DevOps, EC2 instances are used to run applications, host environments, and manage workloads dynamically.


4. How does auto-scaling work in AWS?

Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on the demand. It helps maintain application availability and allows you to add or remove capacity as needed.


5. What is S3 and what are its features?

S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service. Features include data storage, backup and restore, archiving, and content distribution.


6. Explain the concept of VPC and its components.

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. Key components include subnets, route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and security groups.


7. What is IAM and how is it used?

IAM (Identity and Access Management) manages access to AWS services and resources securely. It allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.


8. How does AWS Lambda work and what are its use cases?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Use cases include data processing, real-time file processing, and backend services.


9. What is CloudFormation and why is it used in DevOps?

CloudFormation allows you to model and set up your AWS resources using templates. In DevOps, it is used for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling automation and consistent environment setup.


10. Describe the purpose of Elastic Beanstalk.

Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. It abstracts infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on writing code.


11. What is the difference between Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling?

ELB distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability. Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances based on demand. Together, they enhance fault tolerance and scalability.


12. How do you secure data at rest and in transit in AWS?

Data at rest can be secured using encryption services like AWS KMS (Key Management Service) and S3 encryption. Data in transit is secured using SSL/TLS.


13. What are the different types of storage gateways in AWS?

The types include File Gateway, Volume Gateway, and Tape Gateway. They help integrate on-premises environments with AWS storage.


14. How do you use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch in monitoring and logging?

CloudTrail records AWS API calls for auditing, while CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications, providing logs, metrics, and alerts.


15. What are some best practices for designing a fault-tolerant application in AWS?

Best practices include using multiple availability zones, ELB, Auto Scaling, and data replication across regions.


16. Explain the concept of a container and how AWS supports containerization.

Containers package applications with their dependencies, providing consistent environments. AWS supports containers through ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and Fargate.


17. What is Route 53 and its main functionalities?

Route 53 is a scalable DNS and domain name registration service. It routes end users to internet applications, balances traffic, and provides health checking.


18. Describe the role of AWS CodePipeline in a CI/CD pipeline.

CodePipeline automates the build, test, and deploy phases of release processes, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery.


19. What are the differences between RDS and DynamoDB?

RDS is a managed relational database service, supporting SQL databases. DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service designed for high throughput and low latency.


20. How do you implement disaster recovery in AWS?

Disaster recovery can be implemented using multi-region deployments, automated backups, replication, and services like AWS Backup, S3 versioning, and Route 53 for DNS failover.
